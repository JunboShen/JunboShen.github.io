I am a computer science major student. I have spent first 2 years at CUHK and transferred to WashU to continue my undergraduate study. 

Research Interests
======
I have some experience in Machine learning. I have joined a bioinformatics research project at CUHK that uses deep learning methods to analyze protein sequences. Protein sequences are simply strings consist of different alphabets. It is a NLP problem. Endless nights have been spent reading and running codes. But I am not very motivated and only read papers if asked to. This is something about me that I want to change in the future. 

I did an UG Summer Research Internship at year1. It's about smart & automated aquaponics system.[ðŸŸ£](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ueTK1Te-ViMV46YraC8PchIbfYLkWW8z/view?usp=sharing)

Personality
------
INTP, I am a typical introverted type of person. I prefer solitary for most of the time in the day. I am kind of having a social phobia. But not getting in touch with other people all day long makes me demotivated. Thatâ€™s why I go to libraries quite often. 

I am also a night owl and a coffeeholic.
