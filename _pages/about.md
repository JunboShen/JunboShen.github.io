I am a computer science major student. I have spent first 2 years at CUHK and transferred to WashU to continue my undergraduate study. 

Research Interests
======
I am not so sure up to this point. Machine learning is something that interests me a lot. I have joined a bioinformatics research project that uses deep learning methods to analyze protein sequences. Endless nights have been spent reading and running codes. But I am not very motivated and only read papers if asked to. Guess a lot about me needs to be changed if I really want to do research in the future.

Personality
------
INTP, I am a typical introverted type of person. I prefer solitary for most of the time in the day. I am kind of having a social phobia. But not getting in touch with other people all day long makes me demotivated. Thatâ€™s why I go to libraries quite often. 
I am a night owl and a coffeeholic.

For more info
------
I am always grateful to anyone who was kind to me or has helped me in my life. Thus I am willing to offer my own help to others. Please feel free to contact me if you have trouble academically or have any problems that my limited experience can help to solve.
