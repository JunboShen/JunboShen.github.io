I am actively seeking a PhD position.

I recently got bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science, Summa Cum Laude, at Washington University in St. Louis.

I spent my freshman and sophomore years at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, HK.

<!--I am working on AI for Healthcare and Medicine, focusing on EHR-based patient modeling and prediction, supervised by [Prof. Chenyang Lu](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~lu/) at Washington University in St. Louis.

I am working on AI for Science, developing machine learning methods to resolve computational problems in biology, supervised by [Prof. Yu Li](https://liyu95.com/) at The Chinese University of Hong Kong.-->
