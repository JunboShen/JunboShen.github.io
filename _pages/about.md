üëã Welcome!
======

I recently got my bachelor‚Äôs degree in Computer Science with Summa Cum Laude (highest distinction), at Washington University in St. Louis. I was fortunate to be part of [<span style="color:purple;">AI for Health Institute (AIHealth) </span>](https://aihealth.wustl.edu/leadership/) led by [Prof. Chenyang Lu](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~lu/). Additionally, I have had the opportunity to work closely with [Prof. Yu Li](https://liyu95.com/) at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, HK, on developing ML methods to resolve computational problems in biology, and published my first paper in a Nature Portfolio journal. I am also working in [Prof. Sheng Wang](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~swang/)'s group about generative AI in pathology and medical imaging.

I am actively seeking a PhD position.
