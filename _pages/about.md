I recently got my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science with Summa Cum Laude (highest distinction), at Washington University in St. Louis. I was fortunate to be part of [<span style="color:purple;">AI for Health Institute (AIHealth) </span>](https://aihealth.wustl.edu/leadership/) led by [Prof. Chenyang Lu](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~lu/). Additionally, I have had the opportunity to work closely with [Prof. Yu Li](https://liyu95.com/) at Chinese University of Hong Kong, HK on AI4Bio, and published my first paper in a Nature Portfolio journal. I am also working in [Prof. Sheng Wang](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~swang/)'s group at University of Washington, Seattle about generative AI in pathology and medical imaging.

I am actively seeking a PhD position.

Research Interests
------
AI4Science, using ML and generative AI methods to solve biomedical problems.

<!--
AI for Science (developing machine learning methods to resolve computational problems in biology), AI for Healthcare (EHR-based patient modeling and prediction, etc.)
I am working on AI for Healthcare and Medicine, focusing on EHR-based patient modeling and prediction, supervised by [Prof. Chenyang Lu](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~lu/) at Washington University in St. Louis.
