Some anime series I have enjoyed, and are not stupied to watch.

Not a ranking
======
物語シリーズ
------

Really like the unique style of this anime series. A lot of talks, like a play. A stylish anime that you can share with others who are not into anime.

It is a very long series. There are also many books, but I only watch the anime.

Neon Genesis Evangelion
------

Another stylish anime. I can sense the breath of Japaness life and culture at 90th that I am really yearning for. Really like the OP and ED songs. One anime that can make you stand out for talking about it. But it's  not a very enjoyable anime. Recommend to only watch anime films that were come out in recent years instead of the old TV edtion anime series if you are not an anime lover.

Girls' Last Tour
------

Healing story about two girls in a world of despair. Just make you calm down and want to die in peace.
