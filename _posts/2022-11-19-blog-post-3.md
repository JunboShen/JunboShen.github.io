Transfer from outside of USA is troublesome. But it is not very difficult if you have enough budget.

Genral Process
======
1. Check deadlines on school websites.
2. Check requirements for different programs. Expecially coursework requirements. 
3. Ask for recommendation letters from your professors. 2 leters are enough for almost all schools.
4. Fill out profiles on application platforms like CommonApp.
5. Write essays for different schools. 
6. Prepare for something like college report, midterm report, etc. They are available in CommonApp or shool websites. You will need signatures from registrator/advisor.
7. Finish your application. Make sure recommendation letters and transcripts are sent.

Experience
------
I applied for multiple schools. Only two schools accepted me. For WashU, I was accepted into school of engineering, while for the other school I could only get into college of literature, arts and science to study CS with extra requirements of liberal arts. So I went here. 

Advice
------
It might not be a best decision to transfer to any schools. My advice is only select two or three schools for your round of application. This way you won't need to put too much effort in your transfer applications, and can decide whether you want to transfer out or not after you receive your offers without considering your loss of time and effort. Ohterwise, you will be just like me, spent too much effort but only accepted into some safety schools.

For CS, best candidates for CUHK students or students in any of Top3 universities in HK are Umich LSA CS program, UIUC CS+#, UT Austin, University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison, etc. Basically all big public schools. UC system shools are very hard to get in if you are out-state or international. Umich is the easiest TOP30 school to get in with many cases of success in CUHKSZ. It seems that you can get in with a minimum of 3.5/3.6 GPA. No private schools are worth applying. Pure lottery if you went to a school outside of the USA. F those Ivy League or any top20 private Schools. 

Except for GPA, other stuffs in your CV are not so important, unless you have paper published or something in a same level. Essays writing is very important. You better refer to some instructions online.
