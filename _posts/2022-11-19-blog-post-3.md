Transfer from outside of USA is troublesome and difficult. 

Genral Process
======
1. Check deadlines on school websites.
2. Check requirements for different programs. Expecially coursework requirements. 
3. Ask for recommendation letters from your professors. 2 letters are enough for almost all schools.
4. Fill out profiles on application platforms like CommonApp.
5. Write essays for different schools. 
6. Prepare for something like college report, midterm report, etc. They are available in CommonApp or shool websites. You will need signatures from registrator/advisor.
7. Finish your application. Make sure recommendation letters and transcripts are sent beofore deadlines.

Experience
------
I applied for multiple schools, all in TOP30. Only two schools accepted me. For WashU, I was accepted into school of engineering, while for the other school, Umich, I could only get into college of literature, arts and science to study CS with extra requirements of liberal arts. So I went here. 

After I came here, I noticed that being a undergraduate from a USA college at the beginning has many privileges during the tranfer process. Most admission officers have no idea what's the level of your shools if you come from outside of US. It is similar to Master application. Students from CUHK and other Top3 HK schools cannot get into a descent CS Master program in US due to the serious GPA deflation.

Advice
------
My advice is only selecting two or three schools. This way you won't need to put too much effort in your transfer applications, and can decide whether you want to transfer out or not after you receive your offers without considering sunk costs. Ohterwise, you will spent too much time but only accepted into some safety schools.

For CS, best candidates for CUHK students or students in any of Top3 universities in HK and similar level shools in China are Umich LSA CS program, UIUC CS+#, UT Austin, University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison, etc. Basically all big public schools. UC system shools are very hard to get in if you are out-state or international. Umich is the easiest TOP30 school to get in with many cases of success in CUHKSZ. It seems that you can get in with a minimum of 3.5/3.6 GPA. No private schools are worth applying for. They are pure lotteries if you went to a school outside of the USA. 

Except for GPA, other stuffs in your CV are not so important, unless you have paper published or something in a same level. Essays writing is very important. You better refer to some instructions online.
